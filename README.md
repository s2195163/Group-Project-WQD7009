The document focuses on the anticipation of air travel expenses of Indian airlines using a dataset obtained from the "Ease My Trip" website. It emphasizes the importance of flight price prediction in aiding travelers and optimizing pricing strategies for airlines and travel agents. The study explores the methodology for predicting flight prices, including the dataset description, business understanding, and methodology. The dataset contains multidimensional information about flight prices, encompassing details such as airline names, departure dates, locations, routes, departure times, arrival times, flight durations, total stops, additional information, and prices. It also discusses the SEMMA methodology as an essential approach for analyzing flight price prediction datasets. The SEMMA process involves sample selection, data exploration, modification, modeling, and evaluation. The dataset undergoes data cleansing, feature engineering, and data transformation to enhance predictive model accuracy. Furthermore, the document presents time series analysis, sequence analysis, and model comparison, evaluating the performance of various predictive models, such as Least Angle Regression (LARS), Gradient Boosting, Memory Based Reasoning Model (MBRM), Neural Network, and Auto Neural Network. The models are assessed based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Average Squared Error (ASE). The Auto Neural Network is identified as the best performer with the lowest ASE on the validation set, showcasing higher accuracy in identifying patterns. The summary statistics and score ranking graphs provide a comprehensive comparison of the models' performance, highlighting the predictive accuracy and discrepancies between the predicted and target values. The Auto Neural Network emerges as the model with the lowest training ASE, indicating high accuracy in identifying patterns in the training data. The document concludes with a detailed overview of the performance of each model, considering metrics such as ASE and MAE, providing insights into their predictive accuracy and effectiveness in anticipating air travel expenses.
